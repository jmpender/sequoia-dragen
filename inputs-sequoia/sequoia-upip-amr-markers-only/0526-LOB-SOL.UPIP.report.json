AMR markers are based on the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD, version 3.2.8). Association between microorganisms and AMR marker is based on scientific literature and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database Prevalence Data (CARD Prevalence, version 4.0.1) from McMaster University. Detection of an AMR marker is reported if the AMR marker passes a minimum detection threshold, regardless of associated microorganism detection. Reported AMR markers may originate from microorganisms that did not meet detection thresholds or microorganisms not targeted by the test. Reported AMR markers have been associated with antimicrobial resistance but may not always indicate phenotypic resistance. Failure to detect AMR markers does not always indicate phenotypic susceptibility.
