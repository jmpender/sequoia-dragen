Contamination with microorganisms is possible during specimen collection, transport, and processing. Closely related microorganisms may be misidentified based on sequence homology to species present in the database. The identification of cDNA or DNA sequences from a microorganism does not confirm that the identified microorganism is causing symptoms, is viable, or is infectious. Recombinant viral strains may not be reported or may be reported as one or more individual viruses. Should one or more individual viruses be reported for a recombinant viral strain, antiviral resistance results may be inaccurate."}, {"header": "ADDITIONAL_LIMITATIONS", "paragraph": "The best matching allele is reported for each detected bacterial AMR gene family. If two or more alleles within the same bacterial AMR gene family are detected, only the allele with the higher confidence will be reported as the best match unless multiple alleles have a High confidence interpretation (100% coverage and PID).
