Additional comments regarding CLSI intrinsic resistance definitions may be reported in footnotes specific to the detected microorganism(s). Some intrinsic resistance is described with reference to drug classes rather than specific antimicrobials. Users may reference CLSI Glossary I (Part 1 and Part 2): Class and Subclass Designations and Generic Names for information on how CLSI categorizes antimicrobials and drug classes."}, {"header": "CATEGORY_AMR", "paragraph": "Confidence of bacterial AMR marker detection is shown as High, Medium, or Low and is based on the available sequencing data. High confidence indicates that a bacterial AMR marker has 100% protein sequence coverage and 100% protein sequence percent identity (PID). Medium confidence indicates that a bacterial AMR marker has \u226590% protein sequence coverage and \u226590% protein sequence percent identity (PID). Low confidence indicates that a bacterial AMR marker has \u226560% protein sequence coverage and \u226580% protein sequence percent identity (PID)."}, {"header": "CATEGORY_PHENOTYPIC_GROUP", "paragraph": "Targeted microorganisms are classified into three Phenotypic Groups based on general association with normal flora, colonization, or contamination from the environment or other sources, as well as based on general association with disease.

Phenotypic Group 1: Microorganisms that are frequently considered part of the normal flora, colonizers, or contaminants but may be associated with disease in certain settings. Phenotypic Group 2: Microorganisms that may represent normal flora, colonizers, or contaminants but that are frequently associated with disease.

The identification of cDNA or DNA sequences from a microorganism does not confirm that the identified microorganism is causing symptoms, is viable, or is infectious.
