Bacterial AMR markers are based on the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD, version 3.2.8) and viral AMR markers are based on World Health Organization (WHO) Influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) and polymerase acidic protein inhibitor (PAI) Reduced Susceptibility Marker Tables (07 March 2023 version). Detection of an AMR marker is reported if the AMR marker passes a minimum detection threshold and if one or more of the microorganisms associated with the AMR marker is also detected, in alignment with guidance provided by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) MIC.21855. However, reported AMR markers may originate from microorganisms that did not meet detection thresholds or microorganisms not targeted by the test. Association between microorganisms and bacterial AMR marker is based on scientific literature and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database Prevalence Data (CARD Prevalence, version 4.0.1) from McMaster University. Reported AMR markers have been associated with antimicrobial resistance but may not always indicate phenotypic resistance. Failure to detect AMR markers does not always indicate phenotypic susceptibility. Results should be interpreted in the context of all available information."}, {"header": "CATEGORY_AMR", "paragraph": "Linkage between bacterial AMR marker, antimicrobial, and drug class is based on the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD, version 3.2.8) from McMaster University, ResFinder (version 2.2.1), NCBI Reference Gene Catalog (version 2023-09-26.1), EUCAST expert rules on indicator agents (2019-2023), and CLSI Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (M100 34th Edition).
