Contamination with microorganisms is possible during specimen collection, transport, and processing. Closely related microorganisms may be misidentified based on sequence homology to species present in the database. The identification of DNA sequences from a microorganism does not confirm that the identified microorganism is causing symptoms, is viable, or is infectious. Recombinant viral strains may not be reported or may be reported as one or more individual viruses. The Enterobacter cloacae complex may not be reported if targeted species members (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Enterobacter cancerogenus) are not present."}, {"header": "ADDITIONAL_LIMITATIONS", "paragraph": "The best matching allele is reported for each detected AMR gene family. If two or more alleles within the same AMR gene family are detected, only the allele with the higher confidence will be reported as the best match unless multiple alleles have a High confidence interpretation (100% protein sequence coverage and PID). In bacterial strains containing insertion-deletion mutations (indels), there is a risk of false positive or false negative results for other resistance mutations within a region of 100 nucleotides around the indel."}, {"header": "ADDITIONAL_LIMITATIONS", "paragraph": "Information provided by DRAGEN Microbial Enrichment Plus is based on scientific knowledge and has been curated; however, scientific knowledge evolves and information about associated microorganism and associated resistance may not always be complete and/or correct.
