Detection of an AMR marker is reported if the AMR marker passes a minimum detection threshold and if one or more of the microorganisms associated with the AMR marker is also detected, in alignment with guidance provided by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) MIC.21855. However, reported AMR markers may originate from microorganisms that did not meet detection thresholds or microorganisms not targeted by the test. Association between microorganisms and AMR marker is based on scientific literature and the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database Prevalence Data (CARD Prevalence, version 4.0.1) from McMaster University. 3,968 out of 4,371 AMR markers are associated with a microorganism targeted by UPIP.
