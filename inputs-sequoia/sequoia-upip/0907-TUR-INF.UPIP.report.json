High confidence indicates that an AMR marker has 100% protein sequence coverage and 100% protein sequence percent identity (PID). Medium confidence indicates that an AMR marker has \u226590% protein sequence coverage and \u226590% protein sequence percent identity (PID). Low confidence indicates that an AMR marker has \u226560% protein sequence coverage and \u226580% protein sequence percent identity (PID)."}, {"header": "CATEGORY_PHENOTYPIC_GROUP", "paragraph": "Targeted microorganisms are classified into three Phenotypic Groups based on general association with urinary tract infections, normal flora, colonization, or contamination from the environment or other sources.
